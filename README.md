# General repo for depositing teaching materials

This repository holds various teaching materials I use.

The template is from [Software Carpentry][swc-site] and [Data Carpentry][dc-site]'s template for creating websites for workshops.

See [these instructions if interested](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template)
